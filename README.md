This is repository for my own former Hackintosh (macOS on PC hardware) builds.

Unfortunately, with a shift to their own hardware, Apple consistently makes a usual Hackintosher's life more difficult. Now I should admin that it's time to buy a legit Mac or switch to the Linux. Security laxes needed to run Hackintosh nowadays are not worth to do that anymore.

That was a really good, a decade years long, miraculous trip to run a Hackintosh! macOS really shown itself as a best OS ever.
Thanks, Hackintosh community. Thanks, Apple.
Bye.
