Generate new serial numbers in PlatformInfo for MLB, SystemSerialNumber and SystemUUID.

Notes:
- Since Sonoma, if you need working Broadcom WiFi, it's impossible to keep SIP and SecureBoot on, so they are disabled here.
- If you really need them and want to do, feel free to re-enable, system will boot but will have some limitations.
- After system install use OCLP to add Broadcom WiFi support. Another way - create an installer with the OCLP.
